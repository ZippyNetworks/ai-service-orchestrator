# **AI Agent Framework**

[![AGPL v3 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20v3-blue)](./LICENSE)

## **Overview**
The AI Agent Framework is an **open-source, modular, and scalable multi-agent system** designed to support the development, testing, deployment, and optimization of distributed services. The framework aims to empower AI-driven development workflows through dynamic, automated agent collaboration across heterogeneous environments.

With initial tasks like automated code generation, testing, optimization, and deployment, the system is built to evolve and learn through iterative improvementsâ€”making it ideal for complex, large-scale AI-powered projects.

## **Key Features**
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Modular design with specialized agents for coding, testing, deployment, and optimization tasks.
- **Redis-Backed Task Queue:** Decoupled task execution using Redis for scalable, real-time messaging.
- **Containerized Services:** Easily deployable using Docker Compose to ensure smooth integration and isolation.
- **Extensibility:** New agents and services can be added dynamically to expand project scope.
- **Creative Expansion:** Agents designed to collaborate and build increasingly complex systems, including autonomous service discovery and execution.

## **Architecture Overview**
![Architecture Diagram Placeholder](./docs/architecture-diagram.png)

1. **Coding Agent:**  
   - Generates, updates, or refactors code based on given task definitions.  
   - Listens to the Redis task queue and writes completed code to designated files.  

2. **Testing Agent:**  
   - Automatically runs tests on newly generated or modified code using pytest or similar frameworks.  
   - Captures results and logs success or failure back to the system.

3. **Deployment Agent:**  
   - Deploys services and generated code to the appropriate environments.  
   - Supports deployment strategies for containerized, cloud-based, or on-prem setups.

4. **Optimization Agent:**  
   - Applies static analysis tools (e.g., Flake8) and optimization techniques to improve performance and maintainability.  

5. **Orchestrator:**  
   - Manages the coordination of tasks between the various agents.  
   - Monitors task execution, retries failed tasks, and ensures system health.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Redis (containerized via Docker Compose)

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZippyTechnologies/ai-agent-framework.git
   cd ai-agent-framework
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Build Docker services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

5. **Run the framework:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Monitor logs:**  
   Use the following command to see the real-time activity of agents:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. **Add tasks to the system via Redis:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it redis_ai_agent redis-cli
   RPUSH task_queue '{"type": "code", "description": "Create a simple Python function", "file_name": "simple_function.py", "code_snippet": "def greet(name):\\n    return f\'Hello, {name}!\'"}'
   ```

2. **Agents automatically listen for tasks:**  
   - Coding Agent writes the specified function to a Python file.  
   - Testing Agent triggers test scripts to ensure correctness.  
   - Optimization Agent analyzes and suggests improvements.  
   - Deployment Agent sets up services for deployment.
